﻿The University of Florida student chapter of the [Society of Composers, Inc](http://www.societyofcomposers.org). will be hosting on March 15th 2014 at 3 P.M. a recital in MUB 101 which will feature *Long Island Iced Tea* (2014), a piece for fixed media I recently wrote. A long island iced tea is arguably the most deceiving drink there is. A typical recipe will include vodka, tequila, gin, triple sec, sour mix, all topped off with cola, but not a single drop of iced tea, in spite of its appearance. My piece is a long island iced tea of sorts, where a banjo improvises surrounded by clouds of hydrogen, except the banjo is actually a comb-filtered lawn mower. The hydrogen clouds come from an application of Rydberg’s formula, which describes with incredible accuracy the quantum leaps of electrons as light passes through excited hydrogen gas. These leaps leave a trace of spectral lines and their spectra, transposed to audible frequencies, comprise the cloudy sounds in the piece. If getting inebriated is the intention, then this piece, just like the drink, will surely hit the spot.﻿﻿
