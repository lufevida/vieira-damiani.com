On Friday, February 19th, I will present my 8-channel electroacoustic piece called *Microminitronics* (2016) at the 57th Unbalanced Connection. Microminitronics is a piece in 19-tone equal temperament in which a harmonic framework is developed by exploring heterodynes of a center frequency that are not fast enough to constitute a frequency modulation. These heterodynes' relative durations to one another are given by ever-changing duty cycles of rectangular waves, the "modulator" waves. Additive synthesis of harmonically related partials is unraveled on top of it all, adding harmonic and rhythmic diversity.
