I am very excited to announce my Graduate Recital! I am particularly thrilled for having been able to finish a new piece for small ensemble called Triton Shells (2012) in time for this event. The program will have Four Piano Pieces (2000), Instrumental Quintet (2008), Trio Sonata (2010), Oasis (2012), as well as Triton Shells (2012), which I will conduct. Violinists Leslee Smucker, Valeria Frege and myself, violist Ashley Frith, cellists Natalie Schulthess and Michael Amos, and pianist and harpsichordist Jeff Chodil will join lovely flutist Erica Barden in Barness Recital Hall on October 26th 2012 at 7:30 P.M.
