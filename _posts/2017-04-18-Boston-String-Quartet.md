The [Boston String Quartet](http://www.bostonstringquartet.com) will perform on April 18th of 2017  my *Passacaglia* (2013). The performance will take place at University of Florida in MUB 101. The quartet is comprised by Christopher Vuk, Angel Valchinov, Chen Lin, and Kett-Chuan Lee. *Passacaglia* for string quartet is an homage to Ruth Crawford Seeger's triple passacaglia, a procedure in which three levels of coherence are maintained through rotations of a series and through employing this series to generate syntax. These three levels unfold in the foremost ground at the first rotated instance, in the middle ground at each time a new rotation starts, and in the background at the beginning of new sections. Every new section provides harmonic variety by featuring a transposed, inverted, retrograded or retrograded and inverted instances of the series.
