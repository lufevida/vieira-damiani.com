It is time for the city of Seia in Portugal to check out O Guri, a full-featured cinematic production for which I wrote the original music. The movie already won the Best Feature Soundtrack award at the 6th Cinefantasy International Fantastic Film Festival in 2011 and will now be presented in the Cineteatro at the Casa Municipal de Cultura as part of [Cine'Eco](http://www.cineecoseia.org) 2012 Festival Internacional de Cinema Ambiental da Serra da Estrela on October 8th 2012 at 3 P.M.
