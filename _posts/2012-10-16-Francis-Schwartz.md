tagline: On October 16th 2012 I had the pleasure of meeting fellow Gaucho composer Francis Schwartz, who like me now lives in Florida. He came to USF for a composition masterclass and recital. Schwartz's work is absolutely extraordinary, and his adventures around the world just fascinating. He even stayed in Porto Alegre, the city where I grew up, for a whole month during a series of performances of his works by the Porto Alegre Symphony, upon which occasion he was awarded by the governor the title of honorary Gaucho! This photo was taken by <a href="http://www.stephaniebrauerweddings.com/blog">Stephanie Brauer</a>, a wonderful photographer who accompanied Schwartz and shows from left to right Prof. Paul Reller, Francis Schwartz and myself.
