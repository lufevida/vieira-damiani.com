On July 7th at the [Cine 7](http://www.cine7.com.br) in Bagé, Brazil, the feature film *O Guri* by Zeca Brito will be premiered. After a few years in the making, everybody involved, including myself as the composer of its original music, is absolutely thrilled to watch it on the big screen! The original music features amazing flutist Artur Elias Carneiro and cellist Rodrigo Andrade Silveira.
