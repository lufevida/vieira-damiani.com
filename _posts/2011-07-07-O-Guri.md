tagline: <em>O Guri</em> is a feature film directed by Zeca Brito whose original music was written by me which will be premiered on July 7th at the <a href="http://www.cine7.com.br">Cine 7</a> in Bagé, Brazil. After a few years in the making, everybody involved, including myself as the composer of its original music, is absolutely thrilled to watch it on the big screen! The original music features amazing flutist Artur Elias Carneiro and cellist Rodrigo Andrade Silveira.
