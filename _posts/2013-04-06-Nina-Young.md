author: Luis F. Vieira Damiani
tagline: On April 6th 2013 at 7:30 pm I will give a performance of <em>Sun Propeller</em>, a remarkable piece for solo violin and electronics by the talented composer <a href="http://www.ninacyoung.com/">Nina C. Young</a>. The piece is written in scordatura, going all the way down to a low D on the G-string, creating a most impressive effect. The performance will take place in Barness Hall at the University of South Florida as part of the USF's New Music Consortium Spring Concert.
