Scandal is both a Java framework and a domain-specific language designed to manipulate sounds. Scandal is being developed by [Luis F. Vieira Damiani](http://vieira-damiani.com) under the orientation of [Dr. Beverly Sanders](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/people/faculty/sanders). Plots are made possible by the [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart) and the [JCommon](http://www.jfree.org/jcommon) libraries. Scandal utilizes the [ASM](http://asm.ow2.org) framework for compiling its domain-specific language. Examples of how to use the language, as well as a complete description of its [syntax](https://github.com/lufevida/Scandal/blob/master/doc/Syntax.md) can be found in the repository's [doc](https://github.com/lufevida/Scandal/blob/master/doc) folder. Examples of how to use the framework can be found in the repository's [examples](https://github.com/lufevida/Scandal/blob/master/src/framework/examples) package.

## Installation

The very first step is to have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed. Then go to the [releases](https://github.com/lufevida/Scandal/releases) page on Github and download the `Scandal.zip` file. Next, open [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), and select

```
Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...
```

Drop the decompressed `Scandal` folder in there. To build your programs, use `command + b`. To cancel execution, hit `control + c`. To use the framework alone, import the `Scandal.jar` file using your preferred IDE.
