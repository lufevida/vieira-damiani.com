[Phi Kappa Phi](http://www.phikappaphi.org) is an honors society that recognizes academic achievements. I was invited to become a member after my first semester as a graduate student here at USF, and on April 1st 2012 I attended my induction ceremony. I have to say, the food afterward was unbelievable!
