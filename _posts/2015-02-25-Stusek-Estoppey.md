The saxophone duo by [Steven Stusek](http://stevestusek.com) and [Laurent Estoppey](http://laurentestoppey.com) will perform on February 25th 2015 at University of Florida in MUB 101 my *Duo for Alto and Tenor Saxophones* (2015). The reading will be followed by a workshop and recording session. I cannot wait to work with such great artists!

The Duo for Alto and Tenor Saxophones (or Alto Saxophone and Viola) is written in three movements, all drastically different from one another. The first movement explores the idea of permutation, concentrating almost obssessively on small collections of notes and exhausting their permutational possibilities. On top of this texture, the music unravels in the timbric and dynamical dimensions, producing long-winded phrases. The second movement is a most lyrical song, where the alto saxohpone sings freely. The accompaniment is a sculpture *da tirare*, where large blocks of harmony built over Perle-Lansky cycles are trimmed to satisfaction. A middle section is an adaptation of a famous (to some woth my background) melody which I shall never reveal. Finally, the third movement is a fugue in which the note collections used for each section are expanding intervallic and rhythmic transforms of the initial statement. In other words, intervals as well as time signatures and motives get bigger up toa certain point, then shrink. A tonelade of voices are carried and passed back and forth by both instruments, making this a ver virtuosic fugue and concluding the piece with fireworks.
