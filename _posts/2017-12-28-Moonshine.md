Moonshine is a stereo granulator effect that works both as an AUv3 plugin, and as a standalone app, for easy prototyping. Granulation is the process of taking tiny snapshots of your sound at random deviations from a certain position in time, then combining those grains to form anything from rhythmic patterns to dense and involving clouds of sound. It can add some shimmer to a vocal track, act as an out-of-the-box guitar delay, or be used to transform synth sounds into the most uncanny pads. Moonshine features 13 parameters per channel, including four parameters to automate the interval at which grains are triggered, in a total massive 26 parameters to tweak and make totally original sounds. All that within the comfort of your preferred digital audio workstation.
