My piece *Stingray Variations* (2013) for solo cello will be performed by outstanding cellist [Craig Hultgren](http://www.alabamasymphony.org/chultgren.htm) in MUB 101 at University of Florida on October 21st 2013. After the reading there will be a short workshop with the performer. The piece explores the serial techniques of derivation and polyphonization, in which several layers of coherence occur simultaneously.
