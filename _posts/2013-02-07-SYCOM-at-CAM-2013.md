Every year at USF the Systems Complex for the recording and Performing Arts and the Contemporary Art Museum join forces to produce an interdisciplinary art event called SYCOM @ CAM. I will be presenting this year an electroacoustic piece named Aural Anachronism (2013) and the event will take place inside and outside by the entrance of the Contemporary Art Museum on February 7th between 6:24 and 6:48 P.M. The piece is split into three parts, the other portions composed by Jeff Jackson and Ryan Muar, mine being the last. The concept is how technology influences art, and my piece explores the use of video game controllers to trigger musical events while playing the LEGO Star Wars Saga. The indoors portion of the piece, happening simultaneously, will consist of a piece for fixed media, electric cello and electric guitar, performed by Jeff Jackson and Ryan Muar, respectively.
