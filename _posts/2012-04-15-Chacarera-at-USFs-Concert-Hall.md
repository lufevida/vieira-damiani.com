On April 15th 2012 at 7:30 P.M. I will have my piece *Chacarera* (2012) for English horn and percussion ensemble premiered in the Concert Hall at USF. Magnificent Amy Collins will join conductor Robert McCormick and members of the USF percussion studio. Chacarera was awarded in 2012 the Percussion Composition Prize and is a piece about my Gaucho origins.
