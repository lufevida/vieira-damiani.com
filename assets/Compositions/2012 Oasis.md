### Program Notes

*Oasis* is a composition for string quartet that borrows concepts from tonal music and applies them within a completely different universe of sonorities in two ways. Firstly, its overall form is a rondo inspired by Beethoven’s Tempo di menuetto from Piano Sonata Op. 49/2. Secondly, a 12-tone row tailored for combinatoriality “progresses” from consonant to dissonant trichords and then back, resembling interrupted periods. Several overlapping instances of the series render transitions sometimes smooth, sometimes more dissonant.
