### Program Notes

*Trio Sonata* was written and recorded in mid-2010 during a week of turmoil, right before a month-long tour of Minas Gerais Philharmonic. I had a task at hand: to compose original music for the short film O Sabiá, which was aired later that year. I had already composed a solo violin suite inspired by the theme while I waited for the foley track to be recorded and the dialogues to be dubbed. When my turn finally came, I had little time, but the work was very rewarding. The piece is inspired by Bach’s trio sonata from the Musical Offering in its instrumentation, in the contours of the Prelude as well as in the use of inversions as thematic elaboration. In the Fugue, Bach meets for a cup of tea with Madonna, Michael Jackson and, naturally, yours truly.
