### Program Notes

*Chacarera* [farm dance] is a very rustic Argentinean peasant dance. Its unmistakable feature is the alternation between regular and compound meter, a quality also present in the Southern Brazilian music, where the Gaucho culture spreads to, that inspired the composition of this piece. The music can be either sung or purely instrumental and, of the many instruments used, the bombo legüero [league’s bass drum, denoting its ability to project over the distance of a league (about three miles)] is by far the most characteristic. A skilled drummer will bring out the ambivalence between 3/4 and 6/8 by contrasting strokes on both the skin and rim of the league’s drum. Another source of inspiration for this piece was the famous mantra Gopala. It underlines the piece’s structure and contrasts with the whole chacarera atmosphere, eventually evoking the Tam-tam. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the pitch structure of the piece comes from the concept of a developing series, in which an original 12-tone row is altered twice by the process of pitch-mapping. This swapping of tones renders a sense of development and movement, while preserving familiar intervallic qualities–it does not corrupt entirely the chain of invariants–and ultimately corroborates the notion of instability advocated by the perhaps-not-so-rustic-after-all peasant dance.
