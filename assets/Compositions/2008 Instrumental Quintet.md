### Program Notes

*Instrumental Quintet* follows the footsteps of Pierre Jamet (1893–1991), one of the first champions of the modern harp, who began his career as a soloist in 1917, premiering Debussy’s sonata for flute, viola and harp on an Erard pedal harp rather than on a Pleyel chromatic instrument. An eager chamber musician, Jamet founded in 1922 the Quintette Instrumental de Paris, an internationally renowned ensemble that in 1945 became the Quintette Instrumental Pierre Jamet and was only dissolved in 1958. The group commissioned many works and was responsible for establishing a new genre. Besides Debussy, Françaix, Roussel, Pierné, Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887–1959) and, perhaps most notably Jolivet, with his Chant de Linos, among many others, all wrote for what we now call harp quintet. My piece is a mosaic of compositions I wrote between 1998 and 2008. The first and last movements served as the original music to O Guri, a full-featured production released in 2011. The movie has been presented in South America and Europe since, having won the Best Feature Soundtrack award at the 6th Cinefantasy International Fantastic Film Festival last year.
