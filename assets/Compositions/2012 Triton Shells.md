### Program Notes

*Triton Shells* explores the concept of chaining in multiple-order-function 12-tone rows, with a rhythmic setting that follows the intervallic content of the generating seriesâ€™. That being said, it is a piece that could not have been written had I not fallen in love with Sunset Beach, a small paradise south of Treasure Island. A place to kick back and relax, listening to the waves slowly crash, where you can bathe year-round watching all sorts of birds fish. Triton was in Greek mythology the son of Poseidon, God of the Sea, who played a conch like a horn in order to influence the tides. I try to always bring a seashell back whenever I have the chance to revisit my favorite place here in Tampa.
