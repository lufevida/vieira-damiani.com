tagline: Scandal is both a Java framework and an entirely new programming language designed to manipulate sound objects. It is being developed by me under the orientation of <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/people/faculty/sanders">Dr. Beverly Sanders</a>. Scandal utilizes the <a href="http://asm.ow2.org">ASM</a> framework for compiling its domain-specific language.

### Installation

The very first step is to have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed. Then go to the [releases](https://github.com/lufevida/vieira-damiani.com/releases) page on Github and download the `Scandal.zip` file. Next, open [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), and select

```
Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...
```

Drop the decompressed `Scandal` folder in there. To build your programs, use `command + b`. To cancel execution, hit `control + c`.
