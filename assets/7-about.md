<h3 class="major">Biography</h3>

Luis Felipe Vieira Damiani began learning the violin at the age of five by the Suzuki Method. At ten he both entered Porto Alegre Symphony’s Music School, where he was able to further his studies in music theory, and began having private violin lessons with Dr. Fredi Gerling, professor of violin at Rio Grande do Sul’s Federal University. Four years later he began taking guitar and harmony private lessons and shortly thereafter composition and counterpoint private instruction as well. Around this time he also played at the Federal University’s Juvenile Orchestra and began using computers for composing music, subject he furthered through elective courses during college.

From 1996 to 2005 he studied violin with Prof. Marcello Guerchfeld, a former student of Galamian. As his student, he earned in 2002 a Bachelor of Music degree from Rio Grande do Sul’s Federal University. One year later Luis entered Porto Alegre Symphony, with which he performed as soloist in the 2005 season. In 2004 he was appointed Assistant Concertmaster of the Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul’s Philharmonic Orchestra and in 2009 he moved to Belo Horizonte, where he remained until mid-2011 as a member of Minas Gerais Philharmonic, one of the top Brazilian groups of its kind.

In Brazil he attended music festivals in Curitiba and São João del Rey, as well as the Aspen Music Festival in the United States. In Italy, he studied with Boris Belkin and Giuliano Carmignola at the Accademia Chigiana. Other teachers include Jennifer John, Jaime Weisenblum, Leonard Felberg, Earl Carlyss, Eric Rosenblith and Kurt Sassmannshaus, with whom he took classes for a semester at University of Cincinnati’s College-Conservatory of Music.

From 2003 Luis has composed jingles and soundtracks for advertising agencies in Porto Alegre and in 2008 he wrote the original music for the motion picture O Guri. For television, his commissioned works include the soundtrack for the short film O Sabiá, aired in 2010. In the same year he received an award from the National Foundation of Arts for his Solo Violin Suite.

Damiani has always taken interest in contemporary music, often premiering works by fellow composers in Brazil (Felipe Adami, Dimitri Cervo and Martin Heuser) and more recently in the USA (Aaron Lepley, Aaron Hutcheson and Geoff Sheil, among many others). His efforts also contemplated the research, engraving and premiere of works by 20th Century Southern Brazilian composers Bruno Kiefer and Armando Albuquerque, as well as the recording in 2006 of the Duo for Violin and Cello (2000) by Manhattan School of Music educated Brazilian composer Pablo Castellar, a recording that won the Açorianos Prize by the Municipal Office of Culture of Porto Alegre in 2008.

Receiving in 2010 the prestigious Classical Composition Award from the National Foundation of Arts in Brazil made composer and violinist Luis Felipe Vieira Damiani take a turn from a well-established orchestral career into pursuing graduate studies in the USA. Damiani’s awards since include Best Feature Soundtrack at the 6th Cinefantasy International Fantastic Film Festival in 2011 and the University of South Florida’s 2012 Percussion Composition Prize, among numerous academic awards. In 2013 Damiani received under the orientation of Dr. Baljinder Sekhon a Master of Music degree in music composition from the University of South Florida. In the same year Damiani was awarded a fellowship to pursue Ph.D. studies in music composition at the University of Florida, where he currently works as a graduate teaching assistant, under the orientation of Dr. James Paul Sain.
